Prep time: 30 mins
Cook time: 40 mins
Total time: 1.25 hr

Serves: 12 mini pies

## Ingredients
### Rice pudding
* 1 cup short-grained white rice (pudding rice)
* 1/2 cup water
* 4 1/4 cups milk
* 2 vanilla beans (the seeds)
### Risalamande
* 5 1/2 oz almonds
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 1 can cherry sauce (for topping)


## Instructions
### Danish rice pudding (The Risalamande version)
1. In a saucepan; add rice and water. Heat up and let it boil for about 2 minutes.
2. Add the milk to the pudding and heat up until boiling under constantly stirring.
3. Add the seeds from the vanilla beans. This is done by slicing the vanilla beans and scrape out the seeds using a knife. Mix the vanilla with 2 tablespoons of sugar. Also, add the empty vanilla beans to the pudding (they still have a lot of flavor).
4. Let the pudding simmer under a lid at low heat. The rice has a tendency to burn to the saucepan so remember to stir regularly. Let it simmer for about 35 minutes.
5. Remove the empty vanilla beans. The rice pudding is now done. Let it cool in the fridge before you proceed to make the Risalamande. You can with advantage make this rice pudding the day in advance.
### Risalamande
1. Heat some water until boiling point and pour it in a small bowl. Add the almonds and let them soak in the hot water for about 5-7 minutes. One-by-one take the almonds up and press them between two fingers so that the peel separates from the almond. Add more hot water if needed. It should be easy to skin the almonds.
2. Coarsely chop the almonds and mix them with the cold rice pudding.
3. If you used the original recipe for rice pudding (and not the one in this recipe) and boiled the rice pudding without the vanilla beans, then add the seeds of the beans to the pudding now. Add it to the cold rice pudding and mix well.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk the heavy cream into whipped cream and gently mix the it with the rice pudding. The Risalamande is now done. Put it in the fridge until serving.
### Notes
Serve the Risalamande with some warm cherry sauce. If you want to play the traditional Danish almond-game (mandelgave), leave a whole almond without the peel in the Risalamande - who ever gets the whole almond wins a small prize.

Cranberry Orange Muffins
Soft, fluffy, and moist, these Cranberry Orange Muffins come together quickly and easily. They're the perfect muffins for holidays or busy weekdays.
AuthorJohn Kanell

Ingredients
▢2 cups all-purpose flour (240g)
▢2 teaspoons baking powder
▢½ teaspoon salt
▢1 cup granulated sugar (200g)
▢zest of 1 orange
▢½ cup vegetable oil (120mL)
▢½ cup milk (120mL)
▢2 large eggs
▢¼ cup orange juice (60mL)
▢2 teaspoons vanilla extract
▢1½ cups fresh or frozen cranberries (180g)
Instructions
Preheat the oven to 400F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.
In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.
In another bowl, combine sugar and orange zest. Work the zest into the sugar with your fingertips until evenly combined and the sugar feels like wet sand. Whisk in the vegetable oil, milk, eggs, orange juice, and vanilla until well combined.
Pour the sugar mixture into the flour mixture and stir just until no streaks of flour remain. Fold in the cranberries. Divide the batter among the paper liners. Sprinkle with more sugar, if desired.
Bake for 25 minutes or until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. (Bake time may be a few minutes longer if using frozen cranberries.) Let cool for a few minutes in the pan before removing and enjoying.


Notes
Don’t use an electric mixer or could overmix the batter, resulting in dense muffins or large holes in the crumb. Just use a spatula and mix until everything is just combined.
Don’t open the oven door, or you risk the muffins deflating.
It is much easier to zest the orange before juicing.
Bring your eggs and milk to room temperature so it incorporates fully into the batter.
Press a few extra fresh cranberries on top of the muffins for a prettier presentation.
To check if the muffins are ready, insert a toothpick into the center of one muffin, and if it comes out clean with no wet batter, they have finished baking.
I recommend using real vanilla extract over artificial vanilla extract.
Measure your flour correctly! Adding too much flour to the recipe is the most common reason your muffins end up dense. The best and easiest way to measure flour is by using a scale. If you don’t have one, then fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into your measuring cup, and use a knife to level it off.
If you’re not using paper liners, make sure to butter and flour the wells of your muffin tin thoroughly. Let your cranberry muffins cool for at least 10 minutes before removing them from the tin.
Don’t just stir in the orange zest. When you work the zest into the sugar with your fingers, it releases the oil, adding flavor.



PARTRIDGEBERRY MUFFINS (LINGONBERRY MUFFINS) ★
Author: Leanne  Prep Time: 5 minutes  Cook Time: 15 minutes  Total Time: 20 minutes  Yield: 12 muffins  Category: Breakfast  Method: Bake  Cuisine: Canadian
Partridgeberry Muffins are made with Newfoundland partridgeberries (lingonberries), whole wheat flour and white chocolate chips. They’re sweet and tart, and so easy to make, you’ll want to whip up a batch for breakfast tomorrow!

INGREDIENTS
2 cups whole wheat flour
1/3 cup cane sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 large egg
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup partridgeberries, fresh or frozen
1/2 cup white chocolate chips
Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark
INSTRUCTIONS
Pre-heat oven to 425F and grease a 12-cup muffin pan (or use paper liners).
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, coconut, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
In a small bowl, whisk together the milk, oil, egg and vanilla.
Add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients and stir until combined. Don’t over mix. Gently fold in the partridgeberries and white chocolate chips.
Using an ice cream scoop, add the muffin batter to the prepared muffin pan. Bake for 15-17 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
Store in an airtight container at room temperature and enjoy within 2-3 days, or freeze for later enjoyment.


NOTES
If you don’t have partridgeberries, you can use other types of berries such as blueberries, cranberries, raspberries or blackberries.
The recipe calls for 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips, but if that’s too sweet for you, just reduce the amount to 1/4 cup.
If you need these muffins to be dairy-free, just omit the white chocolate chips. Or use dairy-free dark chocolate chips.
If necessary, you can replace the cane sugar with granulated sugar or coconut sugar.
If you prefer using all-purpose white flour, you can use it in place of the whole wheat flour, or try using half white and half whole wheat.
If you don’t have almond milk, another type of nut milk or dairy milk can be substituted.

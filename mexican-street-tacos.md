## INSTRUCTIONS - ALAMBRE FILLING
Place chopped meat in a bowl. Squeeze the lime juice over the meat and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.  Place skillet over medium-high heat. Once the skillet is really hot, start cooking the bacon. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until the bacon has started to release its fat and turning light brown around the edges. At this point, you can remove some of the fat if you want. Add the steak to the skillet with the bacon and cook, about 6 minutes. Now, stir in the chopped onion and peppers. Keep cooking for about 3-4 minutes. Cook longer if you like the onion and peppers more tenderly cooked. Finally, place the cheese all over the meat and wait until it starts melting. Remove skillet from heat and place a lid. Warm the tortillas and serve in tacos.

## INSTRUCTIONS - TORTILLAS
Add the flour, baking powder, and salt to a large bowl and whisk to combine. Then add the oil and water and mix to combine with chopsticks or a fork. Transfer to a working surface and knead with your hands until a smooth dough forms, about 2-3 minutes. Form the dough is into a ball, cover with a towel (or wrap in foil) and allow to rest for 15 minutes.  Divide the dough into 8 equal portions, depending on your desired Tortilla size. Dust each piece with a little flour, form into a ball and flatten with the palm of your hand. Work with one piece at a time and cover remaining flattened balls of dough with a kitchen towel. Roll each dough piece into a thin circle, about 1/16-inch thick, keep the work surface and rolling pin lightly floured. (If you want to stack up uncooked tortillas, make sure to place a piece of parchment paper between each other or they will stick together). Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly grease with oil. Cook the Tortilla for about 30-45 seconds or until brown spots appear. (If browning too fast, reduce the heat a bit. If it’s taking longer than a minute, increase the heat a bit). Then flip and cook the other side too. Remove from the pan and wrap the tortillas in a clean damp kitchen towel (or paper towels) or stack them in an airtight container or ziplock bag to keep them soft. (It's just an optional step but if you want soft tortillas, please be sure to not skip that).  Serve warm or allow to cool for later use!

Prep time: 20 mins
Cook time: 15 mins
Total time: 35 min

Serves: 4 x 2c. each (makes 8 c.)

## Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 8 ounces sweet Italian-style chicken sausage, casings removed (see NOTE)
* 1 medium yellow onion (about 8 ounces), diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced or finely grated
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano\
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* 1/2 teaspoon fine salt
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* One (15-ounce) can no-salt-added crushed tomatoes
* 1 cup water
* 4 ounces lasagna sheets, broken into pieces (about 5 noodles)
* 3 cups (2 ounces) lightly packed fresh spinach leaves, coarsely chopped
* 1/3 cup ricotta cheese (part-skim or whole)
* 1/4 cup (scant 1 ounce) grated parmesan cheese
* 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, cut into ribbons

## Instructions
1. In a large, heavy soup pot over medium-high heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the sausage and onion and cook, stirring frequently and breaking up the sausage with the spoon as it cooks, until the onion has softened and the sausage is browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds, then stir in the tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt and pepper.

2. Add the broth, crushed tomatoes and water (swirl it around the empty tomato can to get all the tomato flavor out) and bring to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are al dente and the soup has reduced slightly, about 15 minutes. Stir in the spinach and remove from the heat.

3. Ladle the soup into bowls and top each portion with a dollop of ricotta, then sprinkle with the parmesan and basil, and serve.

NOTE: If you cannot find chicken sausage that has easily removable casings — typically sold at the butcher's counter in the supermarket — you can purchase a packaged chicken sausage, such as Applegate brand, and slice them into medallions. Follow the searing directions above, but don't worry about breaking the medallions into pieces.

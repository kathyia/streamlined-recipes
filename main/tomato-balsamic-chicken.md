Servings: 2 to 3
Total time: 25 mins

## Ingredients
* Two (6- to 8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (no tenderloins)
* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/4 cup tomato paste
* 1/2 cup chicken broth, preferably no-salt-added, or more as needed
* 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, or more as needed
* Fine salt
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Leaves from 4 stems thyme
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano (may substitute dried marjoram)

## Steps
1. If the chicken breast halves are of uneven thickness, you may want to either pound them between pieces of plastic wrap or, even easier, use a sharp knife to make shallow cuts in the thicker parts of the meat.

2. Place the chicken in a medium saucepan and cover with cool water by at least 2 inches. Set the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to barely a boil; then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and poach until cooked through, about 12 minutes (you can cut it in half to check). Drain and discard the cooking liquid; transfer the chicken to a cutting board and, using two forks, shred or pull apart the chicken.

3. Toward the end of the chicken poaching time, in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring to avoid scorching, until the paste darkens a bit and becomes fragrant, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, and stir in the broth and balsamic vinegar until the globs of tomato paste have dissolved. Add the shredded chicken and season lightly with salt and pepper.

4. Stir the thyme and oregano until distributed. Taste, and season with more broth and/or vinegar, if desired; the chicken should be a little saucy. Divide among plates, or make into sandwiches, and serve warm.

### Tips
Substitution suggestions + other tips and ideas:

To make this vegetarian >> use a can (or 1 1/2 cups cooked) of drained and rinsed large white beans, slightly smashed into the sauce, or portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced into strips to mimic the shredded chicken. Saute them briefly before adding them to the sauce. Use vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth.
If you canâ€™t have tomatoes >> try this with 1/4 cup of grated apple or applesauce and a tablespoon of mustard or miso paste.
Dislike thyme? >> Use parsley or basil, chopped fine.

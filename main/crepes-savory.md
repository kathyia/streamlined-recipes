Prep time: 10 mins
Cook time: 30 mins
Total time: 45 mins


## Ingredients

* 3 large eggs
* 1 cup all purpose flour
* 2/3 cup milk
* 2/3 cup water
* 3 tablespoons melted butter
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
* 1/4 teaspoon dry basil
* 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon pepper
* zest of one lemon
* butter for coating pan
* Swiss cheese
* 1 carton sliced mushrooms, sauteed in salt pepper and evoo
* 1-2 cup cooked shredded turkey seasoned with salt, pepper and thyme
* chopped parsley for garnish



## Instructions

1. Begin by combining the eggs, flour, milk, water, melted butter, parsley, basil, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper in a medium mixing bowl.
1. Whisk the ingredients until well blended, then add the lemon zest and mix until combined.
1. Heat a small pan over medium/low heat (I use an omelet or a crepe pan) and melt about a tablespoon of butter in the pan. Add some of the batter mixture to the heated pan until it almost coats the center, then carefully swirl the pan until the batter begins to come up around the sides of the pan to make a larger sized crepe. Let cook for a minute or two.
1. Once the majority of the crepe isn’t runny, carefully use a spatula to lift it and flip to the other side. Once flipped, the other side will cook faster. This may take a few tries to get the heat right, but once you get the hang of it, it’s easy!
1. After each crepe is complete, carefully slide onto a silicon mat or with wax paper to separate each layer before making the next crepe.
1. Saute the mushrooms and heat up the turkey in order to prepare the crepes.
1. Lay the crepe flat on a plate, add two slices of Swiss cheese, a few spoonfuls of cooked turkey, and  some mushroom slices.
1. Carefully roll the crepes tightly, without the filling falling out, then top with chopped parsley to serve.

# Savory Crêpes II

## Ingredients

* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup milk
* 1/3 cup water
* 1 cup all-purpose flour, preferably bleached
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons butter, melted, plus 2 or 3 teaspoons butter for coating the pan

## Instructions

1. In a blender or food processor, blend the eggs, milk, water, flour, salt, and the 2 tablespoons melted butter for 5 seconds, or until smooth. Stir down and repeat if necessary. Or, to mix by hand, sift the flour into a medium bowl and add the salt. Whisk the eggs until blended, mix in the milk and water, and whisk this mixture into the flour and salt; stir in the 2 tablespoons melted butter. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (though 2 hours is preferable) or up to 24 hours.
1. Gently stir the batter if it has separated. Heat a seasoned 6- or 7-inch nonstiek crepe pan over medium-high heat until hot. (Use a 9- or 10-inch pan for larger crepes.) Coat the pan lightly with butter, lift the pan from the heat, and pour in 2 or 3 tablespoons of batter for a 6 or 7-inch pan, or about 1/4 cup for a 9- or 10-inch pan, tilting and rotating the pan to coat the surface. Cook until almost dry on top and lightly browned on the edges, about 1 minute. Loosen the edges with a metal spatula and flip the crêpe over using your fingers or the spatula, then cook the other side for about 15 seconds, or until lightly browned. Turn the crêpe out onto a clean tea towel to cool. Repeat with the remaining batter, wiping the pan with butter as needed and stacking the crêpes as they are cooked. For serving immediately, cover the crêpes with alurninum foil and keep them warm in a preheated 200°F oven. For serving later, wrap them in plastic wrap in quantities intended for each use and slip them in a self-sealing plastic bag. Refrigerate crêpes for up to 3 days, or freeze them for up to 2 months.
1. Makes sixteen to eighteen 6- or 7-inch crêpes, or ten to twelve 9- or 10-inch crêpes

* Herb Crêpes: Follow the savory crêpe recipe and add 1/4 cup minced fresh chives, basil, or flat-leaf parsley to the batter while blending it. Or, for pale green mixed-herb crêpes, use 1/2 cup mixed minced fresh chives, green onion tops, flat-leaf parsley, tarragon, marjoram, and basil.
* Sun-Dried Tomato Crêpes: Follow the savory crêpe recipe and add 1/4 cup minced oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes to the batter while blending it.

* Buckwheat Galettes: Follow the savory crêpe recipe, but replace the 1 cup all-purpose flour with 2/3 cup all-purpose flour and 2/3 cup buckwheat flour.
